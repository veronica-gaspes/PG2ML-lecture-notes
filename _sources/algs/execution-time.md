# Lecture 2

The book
[Algorithms illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org) swiftly
describes three algorithms for solving the problem of sorting an
array in less than a page. It immediatelly discards the three solutions
because *they all have quadratic running time*.

In this lecture we will try to walk you through the material that
allows you to understand this statement in detail and provides you
with the concepts you need for you yourself to  decide whether to discard
algorithms because of their running time behaviour. 

We continue to guide you  to implement algorithms with  Python programs. We start
by doing it for you but we add more and more exercises for you to test
yourself.

We also continue to test the programs we write using programs that
generate random data for the programs we want to test. And finally, we
continue to experiment and write programs that allow us to explore the
running time behaviour of the programs we write.

This lecture attempts to do the following:

1)  We introduce you to the problem of sorting arrays.

2) We program two of the three solutions that the book describes
briefly and discards.

3) We show how to test these programs.

4) We expose you to the running time of these programs.

5) We refer you to the book [Algorithms
Illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org) for explanations on
how to analyze algorithms, including what principles we
use for doing so.

6) We expose you to the math you need in order to understand your
analyses.

7) We explain how to program experiments that can be used to test your
analyses or to explore execution time of your programs.

8) We do this in the context of a well known algorithm that we
implement with three different programs.

9) We expose you to a technique called Divide and Conquer for
designing algorithms.
