# Introduction

In this part about algortithm design paradigms we want to expose you to two of the most powerful techniques for coming up with algorithms.  

We follow chapters 1 and 3 of [Algorithms Illuminated](http://algorithmsilluminated.org) (in part 1),  to introduce and give examples of *Divide & Conquer*. You should make sure to also read chapter 4 that presents a recipe, the Master method, that will help you calculate the execution time of algorithms designed using Divide and COnquer. You will do experiments for a sorting algorithm that is a case of Divide and Conquer (Quicksort) in the first assignment: Laboration 1.

We follow chapter 16 of [Algorithms Illuminated](http://algorithmsilluminated.org) (in part 3),  to introduce and give examples of *Dynamic programming*. You will use this technique and do experiments to estimate execution time behaviour in the second assignment for the course: Laboration 2. 

Hopefully, when you are confronted with a problem of your own and need to come up with a solution you will know about these two techniques  and will be able to test whether they help you come up with a feasible algorithm.

The ideas and most of the material are taken from the book [Algorithms Illuminated](http://algorithmsilluminated.org).
