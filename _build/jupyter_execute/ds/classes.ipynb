    "With classes we can define **Abstract Data Types**. You can think of this as extending Python with new types. With classes we say both what the objects (values) of the new type are and also what operations you can do with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example I can come up with is a data type for *counters*. I have already described it in \n",
    "[A concise presentation of Python](https://veronica-gaspes.github.io/Concise-Python/class-defs.html). The abstract data type is an implementation of something like \n",

    "In a very abstract fashion this is just a number that can be incremented. If you buy one of those you can press the button and the number is incremented by 1. The guy that checks how many people attend a movie in my local film club uses one of these: he stands at the door and just presses the button when we get into the theatre.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine other types of data that are not part of Python. For example bank accounts. For our purposes, a bank account has an owner and a balance (how much money is in the account). The operations are: to deposit and to withdraw money. Here is an implementation. The point of showing you this implementation is for you to distinguish between the instance variables (for the owner and the balance) from the arguments of methods (functions in a class are called methods, and they are used with the . notation as you can see in the exmple directly after the class definition)."
