    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to expose the reader to two different solutions to one given computational problem. We will show two different algorithms that solve the same problem. \n",
    " \n",
    "We hope to illustrate that the question *Can we do better?* is important and has consequences for the programs we write. Also, we want to convey that programming is not just about knowing how to use the constructs of a given programming language, but that it is important to learn about well known methods to come up with better programs (one of the purposes of the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also write programs in Python for the two algorithms. For doing so we will need to define functions, to use integers and lists, and to use ```for``` loops and ```if``` statements. If you need to refresh how to use all of these we refer you to \n",

    "\n",
    "## A definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime numbers are natural numbers bigger than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 are all prime numbers. On the other hand, 9 is not: it has 3 as a factor (you can find this expressed in different ways: 9 is divisible by 3 or 3 is a divisor of 9 or 9 is a multiple of 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no closed expression to calculate prime numbers. But there are many computational problems that use prime numbers, so we need to be able to recognize prime numbers (decide whether a number is prime or not) and to generate prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the problem of calculating all prime numbers smaller than or equal to a given bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the bound 50 we want to calculate all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43 and 47.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first solution\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can test whether a number is prime or not then we can solve this problem by applying this test to all numbers smaller or equal to the bound and keeping all numbers that pass the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the definition of prime number, we can test whether a number $n$ is prime by looking at all numbers between $2$ and $n - 1$ and checking divisibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rather vague description is an algorithm: it solves a problem by describing how to proceed in a way that takes only a finite number of well known operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first program for the first solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to program this algorithm we need first to be able to test whether a number is prime or not. We will do this by defining a function that takes a number as argument and returns a boolean as result. The result is ```True``` exactly when the number is prime and ```False``` for all other numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ```is_prime``` in the next cell does exactly that following the algorithm we discussed above:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To decide whether a number is prime try to detect a factor that is not 1 or the number itself. The method for finding a factor tests all numbers between 2 and the number. The search for a factor is put to an end if a factor is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "For positive numbers ```n``` and ```i```  the expression ```n % i == 0``` has value ```True``` exactly when  ```i```is a factor of ```n``` (```n``` is divisible by ```i``` or ```i``` is a divisor of ```n```.) "
