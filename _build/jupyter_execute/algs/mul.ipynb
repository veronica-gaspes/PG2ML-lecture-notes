    "# Three algorithms for integer multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we want to distinguish between the decription of a problem, the description of several solutions (in our case algorithms) and the programs that implement these algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce two ways of exploring our programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) figuring out how to test that the program does what we want, and \n",
    "\n",
    "2) figuring out how to explore what happens with execution time as the size of the input gets bigger and bigger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is discussed in detail in the first chapter of the book [Algorithms illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org). The website for the book includes detailed videos that explain the problem and the three solutions. In this section we focus on the programs that implement the three solutions. Our purpose is to continue to show how to go from an algorithm to a Python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to calculate the product of two non negative integer numbers. This seems trivial: you know how to do this with pen and paper with what we call the school algorithm. And Python has an operation ```*``` that works perfectly well. So why bother? \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand it helps us focus on a problem that you can understand without any effort. On the other hand we hope to surprise you with a couple of solutions that seem very strange and give you a feeling for how very different solutions to the same problem might be. And finally, you will get to know one of the algorithms that are used in real systems to multiply big numbers (numbers with more than 1000 digits). Python uses this algorithm to multiply numbers larger than those that can be multiplied using the machine instruction for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some programs we need\n",
    "\n",
    "All algorithms and programs we show in this section use lists of digits. Instead of tables for multiplication and addition we use Python operations ```*``` and ```+``` when we need the result for one-digit numbers (observe that the result of adding or multiplying two one-digit numbers can be a two-digit number so we extract the two digits using ```// 10``` and ```% 10```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will need addition and subtraction. The functions ```plus``` and ```minus``` implement the algorithms that we all learned at school to add and subtract numbers. Put some effort in understanding the details in different parts of each program:\n",
